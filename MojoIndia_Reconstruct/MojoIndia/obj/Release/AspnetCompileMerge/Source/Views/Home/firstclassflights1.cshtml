                <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">
                    Now, some people have this notion that first class and business flights are the same and that there is not much difference. That’s not true. Both flights are different and come with additional perks and benefits. It’s a known
                    fact when you pay a little extra and receive a little bonus. The same goes with flight tickets; Additional luggage, extra legroom, luxurious lounges, and better food & drinks. All different services depend on the airlines, and some airlines have far better services than others,
                    make a wise choice while booking your airline tickets. Also, services change depending if the flight is domestic or international. For example, International first class flight tickets cost more than business class, while domestic first class flights are cheaper in comparison with
                    international business class flights
                </p>
                <br />
                <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;"><b>Here are some differences between the first and business flights that you might want to consider before booking your air tickets;</b></p>


                <h2>Business Class Flights: </h2>
                <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">With luxurious money comes premium services, which can be seen in your seat. Business class flights have comfortable reclining seats with extra legroom. In contrast, economy class flights struggle to fit your legs and give you backache & neck pain. Business class flights were started as another class to work among the economy and first class flights. But, lately, it almost merged with the first class. It became the highest-demanded flight class in airline services. </p>
                <br />
                <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Although lounge services vary from country to country, they are top-notch and provide excellent quality services. The menu is long, with the finest cuisines from local to continental. Whatever dish you can think of on a flight, it’s probably there. Business class is full of five-star hotel services to make your journey as comfortable as possible. With all these deluxe airline services, you won’t even notice when your flight takes off and lands. That’s how comfortable business class flights are. All airlines offer expensive complimentary drinks to their passengers. You wouldn’t want to say no to that expensive champagne, now would you? You can get a business class flight at the lowest airfare through a little search. So if you are traveling from Pune, Ahmedabad, or any other city to a long-distance route, you should definitely opt for a comfortable flight, which won’t cost you as much. </p>

The secret of looking fresh as ever, even after a long journey, is a First Class Flight. Unlike economy and business class flights, first class flights come with the most comfortable seats. These seats are limited because it’s a plane and the space is limited, making them the most expensive flight seats. Plus, these comfortable seats turn into a bed. Also, your seats turn into your private space, like your own room, an enclosed pod. First class flights also come with off-plane services: luxurious lounges, extra baggage services, faster check-ins, a delicious menu, and complimentary beverages. When you pay an additional small amount, the airline takes extra care of you. Everything gets 10x better than economy class flights, making your journey a whole lot better. You might want to consider a first class flight this time you travel and experience an exciting air journey.</p>
