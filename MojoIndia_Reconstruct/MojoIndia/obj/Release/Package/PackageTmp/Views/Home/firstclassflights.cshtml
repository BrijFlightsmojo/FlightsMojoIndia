                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px; margin:15px 0">Planning a trip and confused about which airline class tickets to buy for convenient air travel? Well, you're not alone. Choosing a flight can be a bit tricky and confusing with all the options. And what's better than an upgraded flight, right? However, 
                        it's not much about the flying option but how much is the flight that's more concerning, especially for travelers with a limited budget. 
                        Nevertheless, we have come a long way from expensive first, and business class flight tickets. Now you can buy these costly airline tickets at
                         low prices. Luxury flights have made travel more accessible and way more comfortable than before. With more legroom, comfortable seats, 
                        better food, and complimentary drinks, every traveler deserves to experience this. Planning a trip is the first step, and booking your
                         flight is the vital second. Sure, domestic travel doesn't always take longer than 3-4 hours, but that doesn't mean you should travel 
                        uncomfortably. Many online travel agencies, including Flightsmojo, have come up with some great travel packages with affordable first
                         and business class tickets. Usually, airlines offer hefty discounts on flights from major cities, so if you are traveling from New 
                        Delhi, Bangalore, and other big cities, you can avail of great deals on your First and Business flight tickets. </p>


                        <p style="margin-bottom:15px;"><b>Difference between First Class Flights and Business Class Flights: </b></p>

                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Now, some people have this notion that first class and business airline services are the same 
                        and that there is not much difference. That's not true. Both cabin classes are different and come with additional perks and benefits. Every
                         traveler looks for comfort, but not all of them are lucky and can't afford to travel in luxury. But with great comfort comes great expenses.
                         And it's a known fact when you pay a little extra and receive a little bonus. The same goes with airline tickets; Additional luggage, extra 
                        legroom, luxurious lounges, and better food & drinks. All different services depending on the airlines, and some airlines have far better 
                        services than others, make a wise choice while booking your airline tickets. Also, services change depending if the flight is domestic or 
                        international. For example, International first class flight tickets cost more than business class, while domestic first class flights are
                         cheaper in comparison with international business class flights.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;"><b>Here are some differences between the first and business flights that you might want to consider
                             before booking your air tickets; </b></p>


                        <p style="margin-bottom:15px;"><b>Business Class Flights:</b></p>
                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">With luxurious money comes premium services, which can be seen in your seat. Business class flights
                         have comfortable reclining seats with extra legroom. In contrast, economy class flights struggle to fit your legs and give you backache & neck pain.
                         Business class services were started as another class to work among the economy and first class cabins. But, lately, it almost merged with the first 
                        class. It became the highest-demanded flight class in airline services.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Although lounge services vary from country to country, they are top-notch and provide excellent quality services.
                         The menu is long, with the finest cuisines from local to continental. Whatever dish you can think of on a plane, it's probably there. Business class is full 
                        of five-star hotel services to make your journey as comfortable as possible. With all these deluxe airline services, you won't even notice when your flight 
                        takes off and lands. That's how comfortable business class flights are. All airlines offer expensive complimentary drinks to their passengers. You wouldn't want
                         to say no to that expensive champagne, now would you? You can get a business class flight at the lowest airfare through a little search. So if you are traveling
                         from Pune, Ahmedabad, or any other city to a long-distance route, you should definitely opt for a comfortable flying experience, which won't cost you as much.</p>

                        <p style="margin:6px 0 4px 0;"><b>First Class Flights:</b></p>
                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">Ever wonder why some people look fresh after an 8-10 hour-long plane journey? The secret of looking fresh as ever,
                         even after a long journey, is a First Class Flight. Unlike economy and business class flights, first class cabins come with the most comfortable seats. These
                         seats are limited because it's a plane, and the space is limited, making them the most expensive flight seats. Plus, these comfortable seats turn into a bed.
                         Also, your seats turn into your private space, like your own room, an enclosed pod. First class flights also come with off-plane services: luxurious lounges,
                         extra baggage services, faster check-ins, a delicious menu, and complimentary beverages. When you pay an additional small amount, the airline takes extra care
                         of you. Everything gets 10x better than economy class flights, making your journey a whole lot better. You might want to consider a first class plane ride this
                         time you travel and experience an exciting air journey.</p>

                        <p style="margin:6px 0 4px 0;"><b>Popular Routes & Cost of First and Business Class Flight Tickets:</b></p>
                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">You can easily travel on a cheap First Class Flight. Generally, international First Class Tickets cost more 
                        than international Business Class Tickets. Because both have different numbers of services with different quality facilities. The variance is not that big,
                         but it is evident once you fly both flights you'll know. Business cabins are a better and finer version of the economy with fine dining and other services.
                         First cabins have much higher standard facilities compared to other cabins. The cost of each class ticket varies depending on cabin services, airport services,
                         baggage allowance, and other amenities. But, the roles are reversed in the case of Domestic travel. Visit the website for more information. You can also get
                         the cheapest price tickets on the following popular routes;</p>

                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;"> &bull; Delhi to Mumbai </p>

                        <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;"> &bull; Ahmedabad to Pune</p>

                        <p>Longer routes are hectic and can be very exhausting if you are taking a 12+ hour flight. Talk about back pain and poor legs. First or Business cabins are much
                         more apt for longer hour travel. So, whenever you have a lengthy hour journey, make sure to put comfort first. If you wish to fly luxuriously on more air routes,
